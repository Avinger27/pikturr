# Why? #

[swagger](http://swagger.io) is great tool to describe your restful api in a clear and structured way.
But as the spec gets longer and longer it could be sometimes useful to zoom out and look at your api from 10,000 feet.

__pikturr__ is a very simple tool to transform your swagger api spec into a simple uml class diagram.

# What? #

I'm new to the javascript and node party.
So please be patient and do not expect the ultra efficient javascript ninja code.
I find a visual representation of an api spec useful and I want to learn js and node...so I wrote this tool.
It's as simple as that.

# How? #

For now: get the code, look inside and you'll find out.

```
cd pikturr
npm install
 // modifiy the url in app.js to point to your swagger spec
node ./app.js

```

# What next? #

* re-structure code to meet nodejs project structure standards
* add some tests
* provide a rest api
* provide a simple web frontend
* provide some configurable options
